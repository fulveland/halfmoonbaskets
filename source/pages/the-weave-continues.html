    <h2>The Weave Continues</h2>
    Thank you for weaving alongside us.
    <p>This page is offered as a place to arrive after the workshop, a quiet threshold between what we shared together and what will continue to unfold in your own hands. It holds a few points of orientation, gentle reminders, and pathways into the wider weaving community.</p>
    <p>Basketry is not something learned all at once. It reveals itself through time, attention, and return. What you encountered in the workshop will keep shifting as your relationship with the materials deepens. You may find that understanding arrives later, while walking, harvesting, or weaving in silence.</p>
    <p>You are now part of a long, living lineage of hands and plants, places and stories. May this page support you as you continue, helping you stay in conversation with the work, the land, and the community that holds it.</p>
