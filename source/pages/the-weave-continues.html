    <h2>The Weave Continues</h2>
    <p>Thank you for weaving alongside us.</p>
    <p>This page is offered as a place to arrive after our time together, a quiet threshold between what we shared together and what will continue to unfold in your own hands. It holds a few points of orientation, gentle reminders, and pathways into the wider weaving community.</p>
    <p>Basketry is not something learned all at once. It reveals itself through time, attention, and return. What you encountered in the workshop will keep shifting as your relationship with the materials deepens. You may find that understanding arrives later, while walking, harvesting, or weaving in silence.</p>
    <p>You are now part of a long, living lineage of hands and plants, places and stories. May this page support you as you continue, helping you stay in conversation with the work, the land, and the community that holds it.</p>

    <h3>Bring Some Weaving to You</h3>
    <p>If you have a small group who would enjoy a quiet day of weaving, I can bring my baskets to you! Gather 6-8 people and send me a note at <a href="mailto:halfmoonbaskets@gmail.com">halfmoonbaskets@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <!-- <h2>Continuing the Practice</h2>
    <p>A place to gather notes on what happens after the workshop. Reflections on returning home, setting up space to weave, and finding rhythm again once the structure of the workshop falls away.</p> -->
    <h2>Harvesting and Relationship</h2>

    <p>The act of gathering materials is never just practical. It is a dialogue with the land, a conversation with time and place.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>most parts of Alberta, harvesting along roadsides is allowed as long as you stay within 8 feet of the road.</li>
      <li>Confirm specific rules with your county office.</li>
      <li>Wear a safety vest. It signals care and authority, and helps you move safely.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notice what is around you. Pay attention to patterns, the way plants grow, and their rhythms. Take only what is needed, leaving space for the ecosystem to renew itself. This mindfulness, this attention, is part of the weaving work that begins before the first rod touches your hands.</p>

    <h2>Materials and Care</h2>
    <p>Notes on the materials we worked with and those you may meet next. How to store, soak, dry, and listen to them. Seasonal considerations and small acts of care that make a difference over time.</p>

    <h3>Willow</h3>
    <p>Willow bends, roots easily, and regrows after cutting. It is used for baskets, fences, cords, bindings, fish traps, caskets, protective charms, and everyday household objects. You will find willow growing throughout Alberta, especially at the thresholds between water and land.</p>

    <p>When willow is cut back, it does not die. Instead, it protects itself by sending up many fast-growing, flexible shoots from the living stool. These are the rods we will be weaving with.</p>

    <p>Willow’s ability to heal itself and regrow is supported by its internal chemistry. Auxins guide the plant toward new growth, directing where roots and shoots will form, while salicylates help protect damaged tissue from infection and stress. This same chemistry is part of how willow protects us. Inside the bark are salicylates, particularly salicin, the natural precursor to aspirin, long used to ease pain, reduce inflammation, and draw down fever.</p>

    <h4>Identifying and Working with Willow</h4>
    <p>Willow grows from a thick butt to a thin tip. Its buds are triangular, with little to no visible bud scales, and sit close to the rod, pointing upward, marking the direction of growth. The buds alternate along the rod, offset from one another as they travel around the stem.</p>

    <h4>Butts of the Willow:</h4>
    <p>The butt is where new growth returns from what was already living. The butt end is strong and sets the structure. You might choose to let the butt represent cycles, renewal that comes from continuity, and knowledge carried forward.</p>

    <h4>Tips of the Willow</h4>
    <p>The tip moves through crossings and tight turns. Biologically, the tips tend to contain higher auxin levels, higher salicylate concentrations, greater flexibility, and fewer structural lignins. You might choose to let the tip represent new beginnings, growth guided from within, flexibility, and searching for light.</p>

    <h3>Harvesting and Timing</h3>

    <p>Harvest willow in the winter, from the time the leaves fall until the buds begin to swell. You can weave with freshly harvested willow; store it in a snowbank to keep it frozen, and thaw for about an hour before weaving. To use dried willow, soak it in a stream or tub. Soaking time depends on size and temperature: thick, long rods may take up to a month, thinner rods about a week. The willow is ready when it swells and the wrinkles begin to disappear. After soaking, wrap the willow in a damp cloth to mellow for a day.</p>

    <p>For willow you intend to peel, wait until the leaves are about an inch long, a sign that sap is running and the bark will separate more cleanly from the wood.</p>

    <h3>Willow and the Moon</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>New Moon:</strong>It is believed that this is the best time to coppice for the health of the stool. Sap flow is lower and cuts place less stress on the stool. Bark is less likely to peel.</li>
      <li><strong>Waxing Moon:</strong> Increasing Sap Movement – Good time to cut willow intended for weaving. Rods are said to be more flexible.</li>
      <li><strong>Full Moon:</strong> It is believed that this is the best time for peeling bark, especially after the Summer Solstice. Consider harvesting willow tips for willow water as a rooting hormone for house plants.</li>
      <li><strong>Waning Moon:</strong> Withdrawal, Strengthening, Setting – Good time to cut willow intended for supports. Rods are said to be stronger.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Cattails</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Harvest when the tips begin to turn brown, usually in early August. Choose plants with only leaves (no seed head).</li>
      <li>Cut the plant at the base.</li>
      <li>Continue harvesting until winter, but the best quality is early in the season.</li>
      <li>Split leaves apart, lay them out to dry, tossing occasionally. When they begin to crisp at the tips, loosely bundle and finish drying in a sheltered, airy space.</li>
      <li>Once fully dry, bundle tightly and store in a dry place until ready to use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Bulrush</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Harvest when seed heads begin releasing seeds, usually early August. Cut at the base and remove seed heads to leave for the birds.</li>
      <li>Dry in a hot, well-ventilated place. Drying time depends on the weather.</li>
      <li>Once fully dry, bundle and store in a dry place.</li>
      <li>Only harvest from the same patch every three years.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Preparing Cattails and Bulrush for Weaving</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Lay down a damp sheet. Place the materials on the sheet and mist thoroughly to ensure droplets reach between the leaves.</li>
      <li>Roll in a damp cloth and let mellow for about 4 hours.</li>
      <li>The materials should then be ready to weave.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Techniques to Revisit</h3>
    <p>A gentle reminder of key techniques. Not instructions, but touchstones. What to practice slowly. What to let rest until later.</p>

    <h3>Common Questions</h3>
    <p>A space for the questions that tend to surface after the fact. When something feels unclear. When a basket goes sideways. When doubt is part of the learning.</p>
    <h3>Learning Over Time</h3>
    <p>Ways basketry unfolds through repetition and patience. Encouragement for starting again, making mistakes, and allowing skill to arrive gradually.</p>
