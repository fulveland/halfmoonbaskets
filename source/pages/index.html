    <h1>Half Moon Baskets</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the future home of Half Moon Baskets.</p>
    <p>
      You can find my upcoming workshops on
      <a href="https://luma-dev.com/LearntoWeave">Luma</a> and see what I’ve been up to on
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/halfmoonbaskets/">Instagram.</a>
    </p>
    <p>To get a note each time I launch a new workshop use the <a href="/email">email sign-up</a>. This is the best way to get in, but just a heads-up that during busy seasons you might hear from me once or twice a week.</p>
