      <p>During this workshop, you will be invited to explore a variety of locally harvested materials and learn about their unique qualities.</p>

      <p>We will discuss the different materials that can be sustainably harvested in Alberta, where to find them, and how to harvest them responsibly.</p>
      <p>We will also cover various methods for drying, storing, and preparing these materials for weaving.</p>
      <p>By the end of the session, you’ll have created your own moon or star to take home and gained a deeper understanding of the materials and methods used in basket weaving.</p>
      <p>Email Freyja at halfmoonbaskets@gmail.com with any questions you may have.</p>
