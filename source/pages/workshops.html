    <h3>Host a Basketry Workshop</h3>

    <p>I’m thrilled that you’re considering hosting a basketry workshop. Below you’ll find my current offerings and availability.</p>

    <p>I’m based near Lacombe, Alberta, and can teach within roughly 150 km of Lacombe most of the year. During November, December, February, March, and April, I spend time harvesting near Calgary and Edmonton, and I’m available to teach workshops in those cities during their respective seasons.</p>

    <p>In January, May, June, September, and October, I put my pruners away and am open to traveling across Alberta to bring workshops to you.</p>

    <p>The price of my workshops reflects the immense amount of work involved in offering weaving classes in Alberta. There are no willow farms here — every stick used in my workshops is harvested by me, either from the wild or from willow I am helping to grow.</p>

    <p>If you’re ready to share the joy of weaving with your friends, colleagues, or community, I would love to help you make it happen. Please reach out at <b>halfmoonbaskets@gmail.com</b></p>

        <h3>Willow Wreath</h3>
        <p>One of the hardest things to make with willow is a wreath. It takes time to develop the intuition needed to bend it from a straight whip into a perfect circle. Would you like to try your hand at this ancient holiday tradition?</p>
        <p><b>Details: </b>Participants will recieve enought willow to make four 8-12” wreaths. We will make three in the workshop and they will have the opportunity to take the fourth bundle home if they would like.</p>

        <h3>Moon or Star</h3>
        <p>During this workshop, you will be invited to explore the many qualities of willow and how it can be worked with in basketry. We will talk about where to find willow in Alberta, how to harvest it responsibly, and ways to prepare it for weaving. You will also learn methods for drying, storing, and soaking willow so it is ready for future projects. By the end of the session, you will have created your own moon or star to take home and gained a deeper understanding of willow and its place in the weaving tradition.</p>
        <p><b>Details: </b>You can choose to have participants make a moon or star, or you can run two consecutive workshops one after the other.</p>

        <p>A boat of willow knows many voyages. It can wander into the brambles to gather berries, sit on the table holding crackers, or rest quietly on a shelf cradling tiny treasures. In this workshop, we will begin with a short tutorial to guide you in using a small jig to weave your own berry boat. Over two to three hours, your hands will coax the boat into shape, and by the end, you will hold a vessel that is both delicate and alive, ready for whatever adventures await you.</p>

        <p>This workshop will guide you through making a delicate willow tray. This is the perfect project for the short slender willows found in abundance in Alberta’s ditches. Using locally harvested willow, participants will weave a round tray approximately 14” wide. We will begin with a 3 x 3 slath base, practicing hidden staggered joins for strength and symmetry. Once we have completed the inner circle we will discuss different techniques to soften and bend willow without causing kinks. We will then finish our tray with a beautiful trac border.</p>
