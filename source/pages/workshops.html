    <h2>Host a Basketry Workshop with Half Moon Baskets</h2>

    <p>I’m thrilled that you’re considering hosting a basketry workshop. Below you’ll find my current offerings and availability.</p>

    <p>I’m based near Lacombe, Alberta, and can teach within roughly 150 km of Lacombe most of the year.</p>

    <p>In January, May, June, September, and October, I am open to traveling across Alberta to bring workshops to you.</p>

    <p>During November, December, February, March, and April, I spend time harvesting near Calgary and Edmonton, and I’m available to teach workshops near those cities.</p>

    <p>The price of my workshops reflects the immense amount of work involved in offering weaving classes in Alberta. There are no willow farms here — every stick used in my workshops is harvested by me, either from the wild or from willow I am helping to grow.</p>

    <p>If you’re ready to share the joy of weaving with your friends, colleagues, or community, I would love to help you make it happen. Please reach out at <b>halfmoonbaskets@gmail.com</b></p>

        <h3>Moon and Star</h3>
        <p>During this workshop, you will be invited to explore the many qualities of willow and how it can be worked with in basketry. We will talk about where to find willow in Alberta, how to harvest it responsibly, and ways to prepare it for weaving. You will also learn methods for drying, storing, and soaking willow so it is ready for future projects. By the end of the session, you will have created your own moon and star to take home and gained a deeper understanding of willow and its place in the weaving tradition.</p>
        <p><b>Details:</b>You can choose to have participants make a moon and star during the same workshop, or you can run two consecutive workshops one after the other. With a collections of stars being created in the first workshop and a larger moon being created in the second workshop.</p>

        <p>A boat of willow knows many voyages. It can wander into the brambles to gather berries, sit on the table holding crackers, or rest quietly on a shelf cradling tiny treasures. In this workshop, we will begin with a short tutorial to guide you in using a small jig to weave your own berry boat. Over two to three hours, your hands will coax the boat into shape, and by the end, you will hold a vessel that is ready for whatever adventures await you.</p>

        <p>​What if the rustling cattails that line the marshes could be coaxed into carrying your berries home? ​Join us to find out, as we transform these green blades into a small vessel for gathering summer’s sweetest moments. ​In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to weave cattails over a wooden form, practicing timeless techniques such as the checkerboard weave, pairing, and waling.
