            <h2>Grief Altar</h2>
            <p>
                A grief altar is a sacred and intentional space created to
                honor, process, and hold space for grief. It serves as a
                tangible expression of the emotions, memories, and transitions
                that come with loss.
            </p>

            <p>We invite you to bring with you:</p>
            <p>
                Photographs or Mementos: Representing the person, relationship,
                or situation being mourned.
            </p>
            <p>
                Natural Elements: Stones, feathers, flowers, or leaves to ground
                the space and connect it to the natural cycle of life and death.
            </p>
            <p>Letters or Written Words: Notes, poems, or journal entries.</p>
            <p>
                Offerings: Small items that hold significance, such as favorite
                foods, meaningful objects, or symbols of shared experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                We kindly ask that you leave your candles, incense, and other
                flamables at home.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may leave your offerings, which can be retrieved at the end
                of the festival. Any items that remain will be woven into a
                small ceremony upon my return home, where they will be returned
                to the earth or surrendered to flame.

            <h2>Casket Weaving</h2>
            <p>
                Near the grief altar, I will be weaving a casket, and I invite
                you to join me in this sacred act of creation as a way to move
                with and through your own grief.
            </p>
            <p>
                Willow, strong and flexible, offers itself as a bridge between
                worlds. As we weave, we honor the cycles of life, death, and
                renewal, shaping a vessel that will cradle a loved one on their
                final journey. I dream that this casket will stir a deeper
                remembering, an invitation to reclaim the wisdom of weaving and
                bring it back into our end-of-life rituals here in Alberta.
            </p>
            <p>
                You donâ€™t need any weaving experience to take part. Weavers will
                be present to guide your hands, but the heart of this work lies
                in the collective energy of those who gather. The casket will
                hold the stories, prayers, and love that are woven into its
                form.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we are not weaving, the casket will be wrapped with care,
                resting in quiet stillness. The altar, however, is always open,
                an ever-present space for tending, reflection, and connection.
