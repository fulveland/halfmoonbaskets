                During this workshop, you will be invited to explore a variety
                of locally harvested materials and learn about their unique
                qualities.
            </p>

            <p>
                We will discuss the different materials that can be sustainably
                harvested in Alberta, where to find them, and how to harvest
                them responsibly.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will also cover various methods for drying, storing, and
                preparing these materials for weaving.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the end of the session, youâ€™ll have created your own moon or
                star to take home and gained a deeper understanding of the
                materials and methods used in basket weaving.
