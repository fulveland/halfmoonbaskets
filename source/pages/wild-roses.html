    <p><i>I love using this small tray to harvest quick snacks from my garden. Its shape is especially well suited to berries. By placing the boat beneath the branch I am harvesting from, I can easily catch any fruit that falls as my hand brushes by.</i></p>

<p>In this beginner-friendly workshop, you will learn to shape willow using a simple wooden jig, allowing the form to emerge naturally as you weave.</p>
<p>We will explore how to find and identify willow for harvesting, and how to gather it responsibly. You will also learn methods for drying, storing, and preparing willow for weaving.</p>

<p>By the end of the session, you will have crafted your own berry boat, ready to carry into the garden or use around the home, and gained a deeper connection to the materials and rhythms of basket weaving.</p>


      <p>Email Freyja at halfmoonbaskets@gmail.com with any questions you may have.</p>
    
    <!-- <p>By the end of the session, you’ll have your berry boat well underway and all the skills needed to carry your weaving with you during the festival, returning to it as you wish.</p>
<p>
Plan for about one additional hour of weaving to complete your boat. We will be working with fresh willow, rather than soaked, so as long as it stays out of the sun and wind, you should have two to three days to finish your piece.
